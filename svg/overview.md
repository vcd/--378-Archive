# Overview

## Good. Better. Best.

Why make custom animations when “no coding needed” tools exist and lots of JavaScript animation Libraries exist? What are the benefits of creating your own animations?

## Good.

* Pros: Use [Tumult Hype](https://tumult.com/hype/) [Adobe Animate](https://www.adobe.com/products/animate.html), [Lottie files designed for WebFlow](https://lottiefiles.com/designed-for-webflow%60), or or any GUI tool or web service. 
* Cons: Generated code can be bloated and unmodifiable without the source-tool e.g. an active Adobe CC account.

## Better

* Pros: Use JavaScript animation Library like [Green Sock](https://greensock.com/), [Snap SVG](http://snapsvg.io/), and many others. 
* Cons: Dependence on third-party Library. 

## Best

* Pros: A DIY solution using _Web Standards_.
* Cons: Awaiting HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SVG support of future features.

## Tools

* CodePen for _Practice_
* GreenSock \(GSAP\) Library
* Illustrator, Figma, or equivalent vector design tool

## What About WebFlow?

* Pros: No code. Lots of freely available SVGs. Easily add interaction based triggers. 
* Cons: Locked into WebFlow for any customizations. Paid account to edit code-directly. Requires Adobe _After Effects_ to create and customize.
* ...or use [WebFlow + After Effects + Lottie](https://webflow.com/blog/after-effects-and-lottie-meet-webflow). What are the pros/cons?
